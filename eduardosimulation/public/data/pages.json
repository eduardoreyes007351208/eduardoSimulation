Within the JSON file, I organized the structure so that it has the name of the project, short description, thumbnail path, paragraphs, and image paths. The paragraph and image path are containers that hold each individual paragraph that corresponds to its image. In the Project.jsx file, I have it so that it maps through all the paragraphs in the paragraph container and then displays the image. Depending on if the paragraph text from the JSON is a date, paragraph text, or heading, the font size and font style changes along with the font weight. I also added all the screenshots of what the progress of the project looks like and all together, this is what the project looks like so far. I also deployed the website through Vercel so I can access it.",
